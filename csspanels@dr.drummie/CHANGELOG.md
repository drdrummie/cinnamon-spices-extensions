# Changelog

## [1.8.9]

- Added support for styling all panels (same "style" of main panel is applied onto other panels as well).
- Improved debug logging for troubleshooting.

## [1.8.8]

- Initial release with options to style main panel, popups, notifications and OSD's.

## Known Issues

- OSD's are styled "in advance", so on theme change if new styles are not applied to OSD's, try to change border radius in settings, should update OSD's style.
